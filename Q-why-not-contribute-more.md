# What are the primary reasons you don't contribute more to the curl project?

Mark all you think fit!

- everything works to my satisfaction
- I can't deal with the tools (git, make, diff etc)
- I don't have the energy
- I don't have the time
- I don't know or like the programming languages used
- I don't like or approve of GitHub
- I don't like or use email
- I find it hard to work with the developers
- my work/legal reasons prohibit me
- the curl project doesn't want my changes
- things get fixed fast enough anyway
- Too hard to get started
