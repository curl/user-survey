# curl user survey 2026

In order to better understand where we are and where to go next, this is a set
of questions to poll interests and opinions from users of curl and libcurl.
The questions are mostly the same as last year and the year before that, to
make it easier for us to see year-by-year changes and detect trends.

You answer anonymously but please stay honest and fair. Answer only once per
person. Just skip the questions you cannot or do not want to answer.

The poll is open fourteen days from Apri 30 2026 until midnight (CEST) May 14
2026.

Please share this link to other fellow curl and libcurl users to allow us to
get the widest possible feedback.
